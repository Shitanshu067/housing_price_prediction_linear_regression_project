Data Collection: Obtain a dataset containing relevant features such as square footage, number of bedrooms, number of bathrooms, location, etc., as well as the corresponding sale prices.

Data Preprocessing:

Handle missing data: Replace missing values or drop corresponding rows/columns.
Encode categorical variables: Convert categorical variables into numerical format using techniques like one-hot encoding.
Scale features: Normalize or standardize numerical features to ensure all features contribute equally to the model.
Feature Engineering:

Create new features if necessary.
Select relevant features that have a significant impact on the target variable.
Split Data: Split the dataset into training and testing sets. The training set will be used to train the model, while the testing set will be used to evaluate its performance.

Model Selection: Choose an appropriate machine learning algorithm for regression tasks. Some popular choices include:

Linear Regression
Decision Trees
Random Forests
Gradient Boosting Machines
Neural Networks
Model Training: Train the chosen model on the training data.

Model Evaluation: Evaluate the trained model's performance using metrics such as Mean Squared Error (MSE), Root Mean Squared Error (RMSE), Mean Absolute Error (MAE), etc., on the testing set.

Hyperparameter Tuning: Fine-tune the model's hyperparameters to improve its performance.

Prediction: Use the trained model to make predictions on new data or unseen data.
